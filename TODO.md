# TODO

## Preproduction

### Plan out first level
- Plan / design / brainstorm a _single_ level in the game. 
- This level is going to be our "prototype", the chance to experiment with gameplay until we can **create something fun**.
- This prototype level will guide all other tasks - we won't work on anything that doesn't bring us closer to finishing it - no more, no less.
- ___This doesn't have to be a tutorial or intro___. The end goal is to create a fun experience above all else. For this reason, we shouldn't be afraid of developing the level assuming the player already knows the controls and narrative context. We can provide playtesters with a short text document that explains what they need to know.

### Player Control

#### Walk / Run / Jump
- The complete core of the player movement system.
- Different animations should play if you are idle, walking, running, or jumping.
- Audio cues should support the transitions between different actions. Footsteps, jump / landing sounds, ect.
- Don't worry about camera control yet, that is a separate task. Just test with fixed-camera angles.

#### Camera Control
[PROGRAMMING ONLY]
- The player should be able to freely control the camera around their body.
- TODO: needs more research for a concrete task description

#### Menu
- Establish the general design of the menu.
- What do buttons generally look and sound like?
- What fonts, background, animations do we want?
- Should we have background music, apply low-pass filter, ect.
- When the player presses the pause / menu button, a menu should appear.

#### Climbing
- An alternate mode of player movement with the goal of allowing free-form vertical climbing in limited areas of the map.
- When climbing, you'll have a different animation and sound effects that play.
- How should the player transition from normal movement to climbing movement? Automatic transition, button press, ect.
- How should the player transition from climbing movement to normal movement? Jump off at any point, only at top / bottom.
- How will the level designers be able to define where these climbable-areas are?
