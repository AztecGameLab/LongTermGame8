## Notes
- Daniel (12/10/23): feel free to experiment with the shaders created so far, but be aware they are both likely to be changed and most likely deleted in the future. Curved world info [here](https://www.sunnyvalleystudio.com/blog/curved-world-shader-graph-unity), toon info [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.toonshader)
- Daniel: (12/11/23): pretty happy with the curvature shader, custom toon subgraph needs some work. [This package](https://github.com/Cyanilux/URP_ShaderGraphCustomLighting) has actually been helping a lot though! See inside plugins folder for the toon example. Also, I want to look into [buildtool](https://github.com/superunitybuild/buildtool) for potentially automating nightly builds and release to the discord. Big todo-item right now is to finish setting up the github page: set permissions, clean up this readme, ect.
